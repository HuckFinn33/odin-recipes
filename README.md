# odin-recipes
The object of this particular project is to smooth the edges of all the particular html elements previously learned. Some individual goals are as follows:
  1. Learn more html fundamentals and tags;
  2. Implement standard and then increasingly more complex html  elements;
  3. Create an neat and ordered project;
  4. Like what I create.
